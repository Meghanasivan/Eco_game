# üå± Eco Gamify

## Overview
Eco Gamify is an innovative web application designed to encourage sustainable and eco-friendly habits through gamification. By integrating daily challenges, a virtual garden, step tracking, and a leaderboard system, the platform motivates users to actively participate in environmental responsibility while making it engaging and rewarding.

## Problem Statement
Environmental awareness and action often lack engagement, leading to minimal impact on individual behaviors. Eco Gamify addresses this by transforming eco-friendly practices into fun, interactive activities, incentivizing users with points, achievements, and social competition to foster lasting sustainable habits.
